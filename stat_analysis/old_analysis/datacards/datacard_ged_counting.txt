# Simple counting experiment, with one signal and a few background processes
# Simplified version of LHC LbyL counts
imax 1  number of channels
jmax 2  number of backgrounds
kmax 5  number of nuisance parameters (sources of systematical uncertainties)
------------
# we have just one channel, in which we observe X events
bin bin1
observation 14
------------
# now we list the expected events for signal and all backgrounds in that bin
# the second 'process' line must have a positive number for backgrounds, and 0 for signal
# then we list the independent sources of uncertainties, and give their effect (syst. error)
# on each process and bin
